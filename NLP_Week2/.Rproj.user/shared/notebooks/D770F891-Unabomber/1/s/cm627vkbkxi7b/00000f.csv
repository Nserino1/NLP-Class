"1","Introduction"
"1","
"
"1",""
"1","
"
"1","1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the "
"1","
"
"1","   human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us "
"1","
"
"1","   who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have "
"1","
"
"1","   made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led "
"1","
"
"1","   to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical "
"1","
"
"1","   suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The "
"1","
"
"1","   continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will "
"1","
"
"1","   certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater "
"1","
"
"1","   damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social "
"1","
"
"1","   disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical "
"1","
"
"1","   suffering even in “advanced” countries."

"1","2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it "
"1","
"
"1","   survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological "
"1","
"
"1","   suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of "
"1","
"
"1","   adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many "
"1","
"
"1","   other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social "
"1","
"
"1","   machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be "
"1","
"
"1","   inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to "
"1","
"
"1","   prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy."
"1","
"

"1","
"
"1","3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But "
"1","
"
"1","   the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown "
"1","
"
"1","   will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than "
"1","
"
"1","   later."

"
"1","4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This "
"1","
"
"1","   revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be "
"1","
"
"1","   a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of "
"1","
"
"1","   that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who "
"1","
"
"1","   hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for "
"1","
"
"1","   a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL "
"1","
"
"1","   revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic "
"1","
"
"1","   and technological basis of the present society."

"
"1","5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments "
"1","
"
"1","   that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such "
"1","
"
"1","   developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean "
"1","
"
"1","   that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons "
"1","
"
"1","   we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient "
"1","
"
"1","   public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since "
"1","
"
"1","   there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have "
"1","
"
"1","   written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of "
"1","
"
"1","   wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important."
